# ? this film was just brilliant casting location scenery story direction everyone's really 
# suited the part they played and you could just imagine being there robert ? 
# is an amazing actor and now the same being director ? 
# father came from the same scottish island as myself so i loved the fact there was a real connection
# with this film the witty remarks throughout the film were great it was just brilliant so much that
# i bought the film as soon as it was released for ? and would recommend it to everyone to watch 
# and the fly fishing was amazing really cried at the end it was so sad and you know what they say 
# if you cry at a film it must have been good and this definitely was also ? to the two little boy's 
# that played the ? of norman and paul they were just brilliant children are often left out of the ? 
# list i think because the stars that play them all grown up are such a big profile for 
# the whole film but these children are amazing and should be praised for what they have done don't 
# you think the whole story was so lovely because it was true and was someone's life after all that was shared with us all
